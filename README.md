An example of testing a packaged Electron app using Cypress.

## How does it work?

Inside of [`cypress/plugins/index.js`][pluginsfile], there is code that creates a description of a [Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) browser and presents it to Cypress as a custom Chromium-based browser. Because Cypress knows how to speak CDP, and because packaged Electron apps expose `--remote-debugging-port` the same way Chromium does, this enables the latest Cypress versions to launch the packaged Electron app without too much manual intervention.

## Limitations

- Currently, this method requires a small patch to the app, so that it loads `about:blank` (when `IN_CYPRESS` is set) instead of loading the real app. This limitation exists because Cypress currently waits for `about:blank` to exist in the CDP target list before starting the tests.
  - Cypress can remove this limitation by modifying the plugin API slightly. Alternatively, the `pluginsFile` could establish a CDP connection to create the proper target, but this would be messier than using the existing `new BrowserWindow` logic from the app.

## Running and Contributing

Run `yarn` to install dependencies.

After running `yarn`, the following commands are available:

| Command             | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn clean`        | Removes `out` directory.                                                                                                                                          |
| `yarn cypress:open` | Launch Cypress in interactive mode with the Electron app available to test.                                                                                       |
| `yarn cypress:run`  | Launch Cypress in run mode with the Electron app as the target browser.                                                                                           |
| `yarn lint`         | Run `prettier` on project files.                                                                                                                                  |
| `yarn package`      | Runs `clean`, and then using `electron-forge`, build and package the app to `out`. This must be done before attempting to use Cypress to launch the packaged app. |
| `yarn start`        | Start the demo unpackaged Electron app.                                                                                                                           |
